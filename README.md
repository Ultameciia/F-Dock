# F-Dock
F Dock is a static dock that goes at the top of a Voron 2.4 or Voron Trident for use with the MadMax Toolchanger Solution

Use two M5 bolts to mount to the top extrusion. Insert 4 N52 magnets into the back, somewhat inset them to make them flush to the bottom of the keyhole. Feel free to adjust the step and modify it to fit your build.
Here are the nozzle scrubbers this is intended for.  [Nozzle Scrubbers](https://a.co/d/dKHXIwk)
If you're just doing two tools just mirror the dock for the other side. 


08/12/25 - Working on Trident Dock, nozzle park will be coming soon. Trident dock is not currently tested heavily, use at your own risk. 

08/11/25 - Updated F Dock to have space for heatsets. Only one needed for 4 tool solution. Always use the one farther away from tools for 4 tool bottom bar. Updated Single Bar to have two heatsets to prevent rotations. 


08/11/25 - Added my nozzle park solution along with a single nozzle park solution. F Docks themselves now have a spot on the bottom for an M3 Heatset insert. The bottom bar attaches here. There are a few different nozzle park arms from 0mm to 5mm.Â Pick what you need for your build, or edit to fit. Each arm gets 2 M3 heatsets and you use two m3 screws with washers to attach to the dock.
