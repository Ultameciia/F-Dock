# F-Dock
F Dock is a static dock that goes at the top of a 350mm Voron 2.4

Use two M5 bolts to mount to the top extrusion. Insert 4 N52 magnets into the back, somewhat inset them to make them flush to the bottom of the keyhole. Feel free to adjust the step and modify it to fit your build. 

08/11/25 - Added my nozzle park solution along with a single nozzle park solution. F Docks themselves now have a spot on the bottom for an M3 Heatset insert. The bottom bar attaches here. There are a few different nozzle park arms from 0mm to 5mm.Â Pick what you need for your build, or edit to fit. Each arm gets 2 M3 heatsets and you use two m3 screws with washers to attach to the dock.
